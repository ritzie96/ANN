# Artificial Neural Networks Labs

Lab1 - Perceptron, delta and generalized delta rules are used to classify linearly separable and non-separable data. Multi-layer perceptronâ€™s are used to address the problem of chaotic time series prediction. 

Lab2 - RBF and SOM-networks.

Lab3 - Auto-associative networks for pattern completion and noise reduction.
